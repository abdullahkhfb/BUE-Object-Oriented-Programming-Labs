## Project Overview
This repository contains solutions to various programming labs and problems, primarily focused on C++ programming. The project aims to provide a comprehensive set of examples and exercises to help students understand and practice different programming concepts and techniques.

## Features
- Solutions to lab exercises covering a wide range of topics.
- Examples of object-oriented programming, including classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Practical applications of C++ features such as file handling, dynamic memory allocation, and more.

## Installation
### Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- An IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, or Code::Blocks).

### Dependencies
- No external dependencies are required for most of the exercises. However, some problems may require specific libraries, which will be mentioned in the respective files.

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/abdullahkhfb/BUE-Object-Oriented-Programming-Labs.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd "Code Solutions"
   ```

## Usage
To compile and run a specific program, navigate to the corresponding directory and use the following commands:

### Example
To compile and run 

main.cpp

 in `Lab 6`:
```sh
g++ -o main "Lab 6/main.cpp" "Lab 6/Animal.cpp" "Lab 6/Zoologist.cpp"
./main
```
